# resume-sync
Chrome widget for synchronizing and verifying data in resumes/cvs on different sites.

# Motivation
I am currently actively looking for a job and have encountered a problem.
I've worked hard on my resume and I'm registered on several sites.

Currently, I have:
- Printed version in Google Docs in Russian and English.
- LinkedIn profile.
- HH profile.
- N-number of profiles in other different sites.

I have encountered the fact that sometimes my dates differ, especially in old positions. This leads to inconsistency. Therefore, any change becomes hell.

It seems that writing such a plugin for this task makes little sense. But in truth, it is very annoying.

It may be worthwhile to reconsider the process that is causing this problem. For example, i can combine old positions into one large period of time.

# Alternatives
- create a business card website
- use resumes and CVs as the only source of data.
